# 🎬 Preroll — AI-Powered Film Pre-Production Tool

**Live Demo:** https://preroll-zciu.vercel.app/  
**Repository:** https://github.com/ayush834-git/preroll

Preroll is an AI-assisted tool that helps filmmakers and creators plan their projects before filming begins. It uses AI to generate creative outputs such as screenplay breakdowns, budgeting insights, role suggestions, and scene design ideas — all in a smooth, modern UI.

This project was built within a campus hackathon (NASSCOM × IBM – Introduction to GenAI)** and placed in the **Top 30** . It combines modern web development with applied GenAI workflows and polished UI/UX.

## 🧠 Why Preroll Matters

Pre-production planning is often fragmented and manual. Preroll brings structure to early creative decisions using AI-generated insights, enabling creators to:
- Visualize story ideas
- Generate structured screenplay content
- Explore budgeting and role recommendations
- Build confidence ahead of filming

---

## 🌟 Features

- 🚀 **Modern landing page** and product presentation  
- 📑 Conceptual workflow from idea to pre-production output  
- 🌐 Live deployment on Vercel  
- 🧠 Integrated AI generation (script breakdowns, roles, budgets)  
- 💡 Clear UX with polished UI and structured layout
- ⚙️ **Adaptive performance system**
  - High-end devices retain full cinematic visuals  
  - Low-end devices automatically reduce motion and effects for smooth performance  
  - Respects user accessibility preferences (`prefers-reduced-motion`)  

> The current version focuses on UX, visual identity, and conceptual AI workflows. Core logic and persistence are planned for future iterations.
